Hosting a web server we using apache2 to make a server host. 

Web server is a program that uses HTTP(Hypertext transfer protocol) to serue the file from web pages, in response to the request which one forward by their computes HTTP clients.

Web servers have plugins to support scripting languages like perl, PHP, ASP, JSP

How To Install Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) stack on Ubuntu..
A "LAMP" stack is a group of open source software that is typically installed together to enable a server to host dynamic websites and web apps. This term is actually an acronym which represents the Linux operating system, with the Apache web server. The site data is stored in a MySQL database, and dynamic content is processed by PHP.

In this guide, we'll get a LAMP stack installed on an Ubuntu 14.04 Droplet. Ubuntu will fulfill our first requirement: a Linux operating system.
